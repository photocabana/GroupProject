(Anthony) Challenge 1 - Responsively positioning the items inside of the music-player-graphic.

Positioning the dynamic items was different than how I've previously positioned things. And that's by virtue of how I sized and positioned the 2 elements on the main page. 

The key was to use flex: 1 1 auto on both the .music-player-graphic-container, and the #playlists-container.

By setting these properties on both .music-player-graphic-container and #playlists-container, I'm ensuring that these elements will equally share the available space in their parent container. They will grow and shrink together as the viewport size changes, maintaining their relative sizes.

This is crucial for the responsiveness of the .music-player-album-container because its size and position are set relative to its parent, .music-player-graphic-container (ie, all of the percentages). As the graphic container resizes with the viewport, the album container also resizes and repositions accordingly, maintaining its relative size and position.

In addition, by ensuring that the #playlists-container and .music-player-graphic-container share space equally, you're improving the overall responsiveness of the layout. No matter the viewport size, these elements will adjust their sizes to fit without overflowing or leaving unused space.

NOTE: more work on responsiveness is needed as the page breaks at less than 800px width.

(Anthony) Challenge 2 - correctly formatting the data for song creation and communication with the back end.

Solution - Using a FormData() object to submit the form data to the back end. FormData() is similar to a plain javascript object, albeit it's more equipped to handle file uploads.

Key differences - 
1. designed to handle file uploads, easily handles <input type="file...">
2. auto serializes data for form sub to handle file data. standard js objects as serialized as json, which doesn't handle file uploads as conveniently.
    - Content-Type is auto set to 'multipart/form-data' , vs 'application/json'
3. you append to FormData to add key/vals

(Anthony) Challenge 3 Addressing crashing that occurs when uploading a new file on edit song - react-dom.development.js:12056 Uncaught TypeError: songFile.split is not a function
    at ManipulateSong (ManipulateSong.jsx:104:87) 

    Originally was using songFile.split to extract the name of the file from the file path. But this would error because technically, songFile is a file Object...

    Changed it to <p>Current File: {songFile}, which correctly displayed the file name, but if you tried to upload a file, got:

    react-dom.development.js:14887 Uncaught Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: [object File]). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.

    Because you can't directly render an object in JSX. Confusingly, when i console.logged(typeof songFile) on loading of the component, it was a string. For some reason, React was logging songFile as string when logging the state, even though technically songFile is a file Object(?). It fixed the error when uploading a new file when changing {songFile} to {songfile.name} however, nothing would show on the page until you upload a file.

    The solution was to create separate state for the songFile and the songFileName. which allowed the current file mp3 name to display prior to uploading something and no crashing to occur when uploading a new file.


(Anthony) Challenge 4 - Leveraging useRef on ManipulateSong to prevent file name from appearing even on uploading an incorrect filetype

    solution ?

    In React, useRef is a hook that allows you to create a "ref" object. This object can be attached to a React element (like an input field), and it allows you to access and interact with that element directly.

    When you create a ref with useRef(), it returns a mutable ref object where .current property is initialized to the passed argument (null if nothing is passed). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.

    In the context of your code, useRef is being used to create a ref for each of your file input fields:

    These refs are then attached to the input fields:

    Now, songFileInputRef.current will refer to the song file input field, and albumFileInputRef.current will refer to the album file input field.

    In your handleSongFileUpload and handleAlbumFileUpload functions, if the user tries to upload a file of an incorrect type, you're using the ref to reset the value of the input field:

    This directly changes the value of the input field in the DOM, effectively clearing the field. This is a bit of an escape hatch, as it lets you interact with the DOM directly instead of going through React's state system. But in this case, it's a useful way to clear the input field.



To do 11/14/2023:

do get all songs

do get all playlists

create song form: upload button, song name, artist name, album name

be able to route to chat page later

utilize the updatePlaylist for the add to active.
